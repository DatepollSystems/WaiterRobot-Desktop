## Create Release

Releases are created by CI and are published to GitHub releases. There are executables for Windows, Mac and Linux
created. To create a new release just push a tag in the form of `vmajor.minor.patch` (e.g. `v1.0.0`) to GitHub. This
will start the CI. After a few minutes the artifacts can be downloaded
from [Releases](https://github.com/DatepollSystems/waiterrobot-desktop/releases).
